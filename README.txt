Water quality monitoring system

A system to monitor water quality can be implemented using an Arduino board, various sensors, and a Twilio account. The system works by continuously reading data from the sensors and sending SMS alerts to a designated phone number if any of the monitored parameters exceed or fall below predefined thresholds.

The system can be initialized by connecting the Arduino board to the WiFi module and configuring it to connect to a WiFi network. The sensors can then be connected to the Arduino board.

The main loop of the Arduino code will continuously read data from the sensors and process it to check for specific conditions. For example, the loop may check if the pH has increased above 9.5 or decreased below 4.5. If any of the conditions are met, the loop will generate a custom alert message and send it to the designated phone number using the Twilio SMS service.

The loop will then continue to monitor the sensors and repeat the process.

Algorithm:

Initialize the Arduino board, WiFi module, and Twilio custom message generator.
Get readings from the sensors.
Check if the pH is above 9.5 or below 4.5.
If yes, send a Twilio custom message to the designated phone number with the warning "pH has increased above 9.5 or decreased below 4.5".
Check if the temperature is above 33째C or below 21째C.
If yes, send a Twilio custom message to the designated phone number with the warning "temperature has increased above 33째C or decreased below 21째C".
Check if the salinity is above 18 ppm or below 3 ppm.
If yes, send a Twilio custom message to the designated phone number with the warning "salinity has increased above 18 ppm or below 3 ppm".
Check if the dissolved oxygen has decreased by 3 mg/L.
If yes, send a Twilio custom message to the designated phone number with the warning "dissolved oxygen has decreased by 3 mg/L".
Repeat steps 2-10 every 15 minutes.
To make the paragraph even less likely to be detected by AI, the following changes could be made:

Use more general language. For example, instead of saying "Read dissolved oxygen and temperature from the Gravity Analog Dissolved Oxygen sensor", say "Read data from the dissolved oxygen and temperature sensor".
Avoid using technical terms. For example, instead of saying "CentIoT - TDS Meter V1.0", say "salinity sensor".
Use more descriptive language. For example, instead of saying "Measure pH using the Gravity: Analog pH Sensor", say "Measure the acidity or alkalinity of the water using the pH sensor".
Remove unnecessary details. For example, the fact that the Twilio custom message generator is initialized in step 1 is not essential to the understanding of the process.
Here is an example of the revised paragraph:

The main loop of the Arduino code continuously reads data from the sensors and checks for specific conditions. For example, the loop may check if the acidity or alkalinity of the water is outside of a predefined range. If any of the conditions are met, the loop generates a custom alert message and sends it to the designated phone number using the Twilio SMS service.

The loop then continues to monitor the sensors and repeat the process.
